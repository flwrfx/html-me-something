						<p>Wow. What a cat.</p>
						<p>I adopted him sometime in July of 2020? He cried all the way home like a big baby. (It's okay, Tiramisu.)</p>
						<p>Once we got home, he stayed inside the pet carrier all day and all night, opting to finally start exploring sometime in the early morning.</p>
						<p>(I don't have access to the pictures from this time so we'll just have to make do. At least he's kinda photogenic?)
