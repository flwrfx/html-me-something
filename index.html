						<p>Wow. What a cat.
						<br>I adopted him sometime in July of 2020? He cried all the way home like a big baby. (It's okay, Tiramisu.)
						<br>Once we got home, he stayed inside the pet carrier all day and all night, opting to finally start exploring sometime in the early morning.
						<br>(I don't have access to the pictures from this time so we'll just have to make do. At least he's kinda photogenic?)

						<p> He's a little gremlin. Loves to be on the counters (where he doesn't belong) and scratch the furniture (which is unappreicated). He is also obsessed with the wand toy pictured and will yell forever until he gets it. Brat.</p>

						<p> I was inspired to adopt him because of how perfect my roommate's cat (Inki, pictured) is.</p>
